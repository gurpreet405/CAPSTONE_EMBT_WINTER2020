We are very excited to work on the Capstone Project

In this ESE 4009_2 Capstone project, we are using best of our knowledge to make the project, IOT BASED BANK LOCKER SECURITY. Here, the bank locker is being secured using 3 layers of security: touchscreen as the first layer, and the finger print sensor is used as the 2nd layer security for authentication purposes. Camera is being used in the project as the 3rd layer security, as if any wrong thing occured then then camera will take picture and send it to cloud with is GMAIL for this project as, in gmail we can store unlimited data. Vibrator sensor, is used to determine the if any person tries to open the looker using some force.
