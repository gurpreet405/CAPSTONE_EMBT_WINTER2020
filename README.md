We are very excited to work on the Capstone Project

In this ESE 4009_2 Capstone project, we are using best of our knowledge to make the project, IOT BASED BANK LOCKER SECURITY. Here, the bank locker is being secured using 3 layers of security: touchscreen as the first layer, and the finger print sensor is used as the 2nd layer security for authentication purposes. Camera is being used in the project as the 3rd layer security, as if any wrong thing occured then then camera will take picture and send it to cloud which is GMAIL for this project as, in gmail we can store unlimited data. Vibrator sensor, is used to determine the if any person tries to open the looker using some force. Buzzer is used as an alert. RTC determines the real time for the internet. GSM module is used to send the msg.

Hardware requirements:
•	Beagle Bone Black
•	Touch screen
•	Fingerprint sensor 
•	Vibrator Sensor 
•	Power Supply 5V for BBB
•	ESP32 Camera module.
•	ESP8266 Module
•	GSM Module
•	Power Supply for GSM
•	Servo motor
•	Buzzer
•	SD card for Flashing of BBB
•	 Laptop
•	Jumper Wires
•	Multimeter
•	Soldering Kit
•	Breadboard
•	USB Cables
•	5V and 12V Power adapter
•	Real Time Clock
•	Arduino Mega

Testing Hardware Component:Testing of hardware components is done mainly by the arduino board using arduino IDE. we test servo motor, vibrator sensor, Beaglebone Black, Arduino Mega and GSM. 
For BBB: we login in to debian and test few command to show its working properly.
For Arduino Mega: we test the example code using arduino ide to show its working.
For GSM testing: we test GSm testing with arduino uno, for GSM testing we are making a call through the sim we inserted in the GSM module.
For Servo motor: we test the servo motor using arduino uno.
For Vibrator Sensor: we test the Vibfrator sensor using arduino uno.
